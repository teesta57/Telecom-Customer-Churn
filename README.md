# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. Acquiring new customers is expensive, and reducing churn directly increases profitability.
This project analyzes telecom customer data to identify the main drivers of churn and provides actionable business recommendations to improve retention. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, churn breakdowns by key factors, and strategic recommendations.

## 📌 Business Implications

**1. Early engagement:** First-year customers are the highest risk segment.
**2. Contract incentives:** Month-to-month contracts drive churn — annual contracts reduce risk significantly.
**3. Service bundling:** Online security, tech support, and device protection cut churn by half.
**4. Payment modernization:** Customers paying via electronic check churn at nearly double the rate of others.
**5. Targeted retention:** Senior citizens and single-person households need tailored strategies.

## 🚀 Recommendations

**Short-term**

* Launch onboarding programs to engage new customers.
* Offer discounts for contract upgrades (month-to-month → annual).
* Bundle value-added services (security, tech support, device protection).
* Encourage customers to switch from electronic checks to auto-pay.

**Long-term**

* Build a predictive churn model to identify at-risk customers.
* Use segmentation (value vs. risk) for targeted retention campaigns.
* Improve fiber optic service quality and pricing competitiveness.
* Create a churn dashboard for real-time KPI tracking.
